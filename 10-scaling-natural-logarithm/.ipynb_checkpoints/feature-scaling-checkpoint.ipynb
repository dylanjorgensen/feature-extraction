    "### Implementation: Feature Scaling\n",
    "If data is not normally distributed, especially if the mean and median vary significantly (indicating a large skew), it is most [often appropriate](http://econbrowser.com/archives/2014/02/use-of-logarithms-in-economics) to apply a non-linear scaling â€” particularly for financial data. One way to achieve this scaling is by using a [Box-Cox test](http://scipy.github.io/devdocs/generated/scipy.stats.boxcox.html), which calculates the best power transformation of the data that reduces skewness. A simpler approach which can work in most cases would be applying the natural logarithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the code block below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Assign a copy of the data to `log_data` after applying a logarithm scaling. Use the `np.log` function for this.\n",
    " - Assign a copy of the sample data to `log_samples` after applying a logrithm scaling. Again, use `np.log`."
